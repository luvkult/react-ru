## Introduction {/*introduction*/}

Learn [what React Compiler does](/learn/react-compiler/introduction) and how it automatically optimizes your React application by handling memoization for you, eliminating the need for manual `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `React.memo`. [site](/downloads/site.zip)

## Installation {/*installation*/}

Get started with [installing React Compiler](/learn/react-compiler/installation) and learn how to configure it with your build tools. [site](/downloads/site.zip)


## Incremental Adoption {/*incremental-adoption*/}

Learn [strategies for gradually adopting React Compiler](/learn/react-compiler/incremental-adoption) in your existing codebase if you're not ready to enable it everywhere yet. [site](/downloads/site.zip)

## Debugging and Troubleshooting {/*debugging-and-troubleshooting*/}

When things don't work as expected, use our [debugging guide](/learn/react-compiler/debugging) to understand the difference between compiler errors and runtime issues, identify common breaking patterns, and follow a systematic debugging workflow. [site](/downloads/site.zip)

## Configuration and Reference {/*configuration-and-reference*/}
